> In the meantime, you can use it for free in our website [joia.so](https://joia.so).

### Main features

**Collaborative chatbots:** We make it easy for teams to create and iterate chatbots for specific use cases. Think of "GPTs", but shareable by default and more steerable.

**Easy access management and payment:** Today, granting an entire team access to OpenAI's ChatGPT can be quite cumbersome (except for ChatGPT Enterprise users). Each member has to use a separate credit card and generate an individual invoice. With Joia, you can manage access and payment from a single point.

**Speed:** Our system generates responses 35% to 55% faster by connecting to OpenAI via an API, which consistently delivers better response times than accessing ChatGPT through the UI.

**Affordability:** For 99% of users, the cost is lower than the $20 ChatGPT Plus subscription. Our early adopters are paying an average of $7 per month. This is possible because you pay only for the words generated, with each word costing around $0.00008. To put this into perspective, you would need to generate the equivalent of an entire Harry Potter book to match the cost of ChatGPT Plus.

**Privacy:** By using OpenAI API, your data is not used for model training purposes.

**Coming soon: Support for multiple LLMs** We are in the process of adding support for a variety of large language models (LLMs), including Claude, Llama, and others hosted on platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Replicate.
